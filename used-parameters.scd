/*

a list of parameters with special use

*** These parameter names can change in the future. ***

You can use those parameters in your SynthDefs, but itâ€™s good to know what they do. There is no documentation, but the information is in:

effects: `synths/core-modules.scd` and `synths/core-synths.scd`,
global effects: DirtOrbit
core: DirtEvent


Like in sclang in general, sustain parameter is the total duration of a sound (not just a sustain portion of an envelope)
