# SuperTweak
This is a fork of superdirt that is intended to play well with Strudel.cc
The intention of the fork is to be temporary, as features are planned to be merged back into superdirt over time. Features: 
- note scaling is the same as Strudel 
- Shimmer Reverb effect ".shimmer(1)"
- new oscillator types: supersaw, superpulse, sawtooth, triangle, pulse
- z parameters AKA oscillator macros z/z1,z2,z3,z4
- pwm modulation ".s("pulse").z(.5).z2(3).z3(.8)"
- better delay effect with cycle relative timing  ".delaytime(3/16)"
- filter envelopes for each filter type
- distort 
- FX bus gain behavior is improved to work like a mixing console
- gain modules: ".gain" is pre effect ".postgain" is pre orbit effect 
- ".dry" and ".wet" control the relative levels of effect bus so you can get a totally "wet" sound for example with ".room(1).dry(0)"
- relative gain of synths to samples is improved and normalized
- better sounding filters
- improved gaincurve x^2 (as opposed to x^4 in superdirt or x in Strudel )
- Juno 60 Chorus emulation ".chorus(.5)"

SuperCollider implementation of the Dirt sampler, originally designed
for the [TidalCycles](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal)
environment. SuperDirt is a general purpose framework for playing
samples and synths, controllable over the Open Sound Control protocol,
and locally from the SuperCollider language. SuperDirt is also
used by [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr), a live coding
environment for Python 3.10+.

## Requirements

* SuperCollider >= v3.7 (3.6 possible, but see below): https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider
* The Vowel Quark: https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/Vowel
* optional, but recommended (many effect UGens need it): sc3-plugins: https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins/
* For proper usage you need https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal

## Installation from SuperCollider
```
in interpreter options in supercollider, include the path to this repo
```
Note: this also automatically installs the DirtSamples quark, which contains a large collection of sound files. It downloads them as a zip file. Sometimes, git fails to unpack these samples and they don't get listed. In this case, you have to unpack them "manually".

## Simple Setup

`SuperDirt.start`

You can pass `port`, `outBusses`, `senderAddr` as arguments.

## Setup with options

For an example startup file, see the file `superdirt_startup.scd`. you can `load(<path>)` this from the SuperCollider startup file.

## Automatic startup
If you want SuperDirt to start automatically, you can load it from the startup file. To do this, open the sc startup file (```File>Open startup file```) and add: ```load("... path to your tidal startup file ...")```. This path you can get by dropping the file onto the text editor.


## Options on startup
- `numChannels` can be set to anything your soundcard supports
- for server options, see `ServerOptions` helpfile: http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/ServerOptions.html

## Options on-the-fly
- add sound files. `~dirt.loadSoundFiles("path/to/my/samples/*")` You can drag and drop folders into the editor and add a wildcard (*) afterË˜ it.
- you can pass the udp port on which superdirt is listenting and the output channel offsets: `~dirt.start(port, channels)`
- new orbits can be created on the fly (e.g. `~dirt.makeBusses([0, 0, 0])`).
- add or edit SynthDef files to add your own synthesis methods to be called from tidal: https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/blob/master/synths/default-synths.scd
- you can live rewrite the core synths (but take care not to break them ...): https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/blob/master/synths/core-synths.scd

## Trouble Shooting
 If you run into unspecific troubles and want to quickly reset everything, you can run the following: `SuperDirt.resetEverything`
You can minimize downtime if you have a startup file that automatically starts SuperDirt (see Automatic startup, above).


## Using SuperDirt with SuperCollider 3.6
It is in principle possible to use SuperCollider 3.6, but startup will be much slower by comparison. It is **not** recommended if you expect it to run smoothly.

For reference, we leave here the instructions if you want to try anyway:

The install works differently: don't do `include("SuperDirt")`, but instead download the three quarks to the SuperCollider `Extensions` folder:
- https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt
- https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples
- https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/Vowel

Note that for automatically loading the sound files, the folder `Dirt-Samples` should have this name (not Dirt-Samples-master e.g.) and should be next to the SuperDirt folder.
